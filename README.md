# Overview


My goal with this project was to work more with object oriented programming to create a calculator to accurately estimate the weight of cattle on any given date. 
Currently the growth rate per day is set at an average so that I could focus on the programming. But through further research I will be able to get more specific rates depending on the stage in life and combine all the rates together for more accuracy. 
This will allow for tentative timelines to be set to maximize growth and profit when it comes time to sell.


The main purpose of this program was to work with additional libraries to preform calculations using dates, in a way that will accurately track the time in between (including the variable amount of days in each month)

# Future Work


* Create the equivalent of a python dictionary to store different breeds and their growth rates
* Preform more specific calculations by utilizing birth weight and variable growth rate
* Calculate pack out weight using data from the two ideas above.
